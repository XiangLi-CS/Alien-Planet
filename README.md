CSC3231-Graphics for Games-Coursework-Unity    Newcastle Universiy

This is a coursework project that I completed at the university. The aim of this project is to render a real-time interactive scene involving many graphical effects. I created a Planet scene with Unity engine. The above PDF document outlines the features I implemented in this project. You can also view the result by the link below.

All of the assets (meshes/textures) were downloaded free from Unity asset store.
